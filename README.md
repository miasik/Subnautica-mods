# Subnautica-mods
My mods for Subnautica game
## Upgradeable batties set
The set was made with the next ideas in mind:
1. Different batteries have to be available to a player.
2. The batteries need to have different complexity and price.
3. The simplest and cheapest batteries have to be available almost after a new game starts.
4. Top level batteries have to be available for a player before the game ends in order to give time to use them.
